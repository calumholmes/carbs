# What is CARBS?

CARBS is an acronym that stands for "Calums Auto Ricing Bootstrapping Script"

It's a minor modification to LARBS (created by Luke Smith, lukesmith.xyz, larbs.xyz)

The script is meant to be run after running LARBS (larbs.xyz).It makes minor cosmetic changes and that's pretty much it.

# Usage Case

I made this primarily to simplify spreading this environment to other computers for myself. You may want to use it if:

- You too have an irrational hatred of emojis

- You like running scripts from random people on your computer

- Some secret third reason

# Installation

Download the code from github and extract to a folder. Change directory to the folder and run the following:

sh carbs.sh

You'll be prompted to select a theme. Enter the number of the theme you want and it will start applying it.
It should be basically instant.

After it's done, you should renew dwm.
